# Digits_Recognition_GUI
Python script that uses the tkinter library to create a GUI for digit recognition. The GUI consists of a canvas where the user can draw a digit, a switch to toggle between the original and binary image, a button to clear the canvas, and a label to display the recognized digit.

If someone can give an advice how to improve its code, look and functionality, please tell me. I would be happy to hear any ideas.
